# My personal website

I created this as a place to link to all other places were I publish content.

It page is handcrafted.

Since it is not using any framework or build tool there is no build step.

The profile picture is a compressed webp which is inlined, so it is available at the same time the html is rendered.

The CSS is written within the same document so there is no second request necessary to render the page.

It uses System fonts to further minimize the page size.

Favicons and `site.webmanifest` were generated with https://realfavicongenerator.net because I can't deal with getting all of the formats right myself.
